This is the amount written off other than directly to Profit & Loss (i.e. via provisions or asset revaluation reserves), of the value of the reporting party's investments that result in an exposure to the asset class of commercial residential property.
     
Commercial residential property exposure is defined according to the nature of the risk. An exposure should be classified as commercial residential property risk, if the exposure is subject to the performance of the property market for residential purposes other than owner occupation, tourism, leisure or hospitality. This exposure does not include property used for the reporting party's own operational use.
