## definition
Report the amount of vested benefits of the defined benefit members of the reporting party at the relevant date.

Vested benefits are the benefits which are not conditional upon continued membership or any other factor other than resignation from the reporting entity and include benefits which members were entitled to receive had they terminated their membership as at the relevant date. 

Defined benefit members are those members whose entitlements in the reporting entity are entirely determined on the basis of a defined benefit formula.
