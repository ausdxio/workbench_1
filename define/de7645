# Assets Loans And Receivables Term Offset Count

## identifier

## status
Standard

## type
int

## definition
This is the number of term loans held by the reporting party as at the relevant date, and which have an offset account attached to them.

An offset account is typically a deposit account in which the balance is either wholly or party offset against the loan balance for the purposes of calculating interest.

For the purposes of this item exclude loans that have been written-off, but include all-in-one facilities (that is where the loan and deposits are effectively combined in a single account).
